**Abstract**
<p align="justify">At present, Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been adopted in many different domains such as healthcare, robotics, automotive, telecommunica- tion system, security, and finance for adding intelligence in their services and applications. The intelligent personal assistant such as Siri and Alexa are examples of AI systems making an impact on our daily lives. Since AI systems are a data-driven systems, they require large volumes of data, advanced algorithms, computing power and storage in their development process. Collaboration in the AI development process (AI engineering process) will reduce cost and time for the AI applications in the market. However, it brings the concern of privacy and piracy of intellectual properties of the actors who collaborate in the engineering process.</p>
<p align="justify">This work investigates the non-functional requirements, such as privacy and security, for enabling collaboration in AI service chains. It proposes the architectural design approach for collaborative AI engineering and explores the concept of the pipeline(service chain) for chaining AI functions. In order to enable controlled collaboration between AI artefacts 1 in a pipeline, this work makes use of virtualisation technology to define and implement Virtual Premises (VPs), which acts as protection wrappers for AI pipelines. A VP is a virtual policy enforcement point for a pipeline and requires access permission and authenticity for each element in a pipeline before the pipeline can be used. </p>
<p align="justify">Furthermore, the proposed architecture is evaluated by scenario-based architectural method for faster and less expensive error detection of design during the initial stage of implementation. To evaluate the security level and compliance of the system, this work performs threat modeling to identify the potential threats and vulnerabilities of a system and analyse their possible effects. It proposes a method to countermeasure the threats related to unauthorised access and execution of AI artefacts.</p>

**Abstract**
<p align="justify">The rapid adoption of networks that are based on "cloudification" and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) comes from the anticipated high cost savings of up to 70% in their build and operation. The high savings are founded in the use of general standard servers, instead of single-purpose hardware, and by efficiency resource sharing through virtualisation concepts.</p>
<p align="justify"> In this paper, we discuss the capabilities of resource description of "on- board" tools, i.e. using standard Linux commands, to enable OPEX savings. We put a focus on monitoring resources on small time-scales and on the variation observed on such scales. We introduce a QoE-based comparative concept that relates guest and host views on "utilisation" and "load" for the analysis of the variations. We describe the order of variations in "utilisation" and "load" by measurement and by graphical analysis of the measurements. We do these evaluations for different host operating systems and monitoring tools.</p>
